  <h2>The Editorial</h2>

  <p>It all began with a fire.</p>
  <p>When early humans lit those first flames, they weren’t just surviving the cold—they were reaching for something more. A spark of curiosity had been born, and with it began our long journey to understand the world around us</p>
  <p>That curiosity has never really left us. It’s what led us to gaze at the stars, to wonder about falling apples, to try and split the atom, and to ask the hardest questions. But the path hasn’t always been straight or kind. In our rush to discover, we’ve made mistakes. We’ve harmed the planet, hurt each other, and sometimes used knowledge in ways that should’ve made us stop and think</p>
  <p>Eventually, we found our way back to reason—to science. And through it all, physics stood by us by giving us a new perspective of seeing everything, including ourselves. But we should not forget the bigger task…the task of asking – what does this mean? What comes next?</p>
  <p>Every discovery, every equation, has consequences. Black holes. Lasers. Nuclear energy. These all began as ideas, theories, possibilities. Today, they shape our lives. Some have helped us. Some have hurt us. All of them have changed us.</p>  
  <p>That’s why the implications of science can’t be an afterthought. They are at the heart of why we do what we do.</p>
  <p>Being a physicist—or even just someone who thinks deeply—means more than asking “how.” It means asking “what now?” It means understanding that knowledge carries responsibility.</p>
  <p>At the Department of Physics, RKMVM, we believe science is more than solving puzzles. It’s about understanding our place in the world, and choosing to make that world better.</p>
  <p>Let’s not just discover. Let’s think.</p>
  <p>Let’s not just explain. Let’s care.</p>
