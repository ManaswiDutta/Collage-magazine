  <h2>Dawn Of AGI</h2>

    <p>The journey from artificial intelligence (AI) to artificial general intelligence (AGI) is advancing rapidly. Since 2012, AI has seen exponential progress, with breakthroughs such as deep learning models outpacing human performance on benchmarks like MMLU and ARC. GPT-4 and other transformer models excel at tasks requiring complex reasoning, but they remain limited in generalizing across domains, a key benchmark of AGI.</p>    
    <p>AGI is an intelligence system that can learn, adapt, and apply know-how independently across any cognitive activity. A 2025 METR study reveals that current models can complete tasks requiring 60 minutes of expert human effort, a capability that has doubled approximately every 7 months since 2019. However, these models struggle with tasks over 4 hours in duration, with success rates falling below 20%—highlighting a gap in long-term reasoning and memory. The compute laws of scaling are evident: AI task completion is speeding up, but sustaining task coherence over longer periods remains an issue.</p>    
    <p>Former OpenAI researcher Leopold Aschenbrenner predicts a rapid acceleration in the sophistication of these systems, driven by advancements in compute efficiency, algorithmic breakthroughs, and multi-modal learning. He calls for a “Manhattan Project” scale mobilization to prepare for this shift. Currently, a significant portion of the AI progress is driven by scaling laws, where doubling the compute leads to disproportionate improvements in performance—something seen with models like GPT-4, which has 175 billion parameters and leverages massive datasets for training.</p>    
    <p>The shift toward AGI would make automation possible for scientific discoveries as well as creative problems and policy development. The development of AGI presents existential threats because unplanned system behavior and human control reduction represent significant dangers unless proper alignment and safety measures are established.</p>
    <p>AI model development accelerates the need to establish proper AGI preparation frameworks. The direction of intelligence evolution has changed so organizations must find ways to steer new systems toward positive results.</p>
