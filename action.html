  <h2>The Principle of Action</h2>

    <p>In this vast orchestra of nature sometimes the reason of things and way they are becomes quite intriguing for humans, especially for physicists.</p>
    <p>This very question also wiggled the brain of Maupertuis. This question led him to his principle of Action which said;</p>    
    <p>In the changes occurring in nature, the quantity of action is always as small as possible.</p>    
    <p>Action=∑mvs</p>    
    <p>His theory initially received a lot of criticism due to its sudden discovery. However, what people didn’t realise was that Maupertuis had foreseen a theory that was way ahead of his time. </p>    
    <p>Euler, Lagrange and Hamilton together later on finalized the theory and gave it the most unique and majestic form that today is known as The Principle of Least Action. The theory which requires solving a set of differential equations using the Lagrangian has succeeded in showing how significant the quantity action is in nature. The problem of fastest descent could be easily solved using the Lagrange-Hamilton theory and it also shows how light bends through various mediums trying to optimize its action through space from one point to another, proving Fermat’s principle. </p>
    <p>Further, the principle of action gave birth to several other theories like path integral in Quantum Mechanics, Einstein-Hilbert action in General relativity and many more.</p>
