  <h2>Marvel of Microchips</h2>

  <p>We live in a time surrounded by electronic devices. From a child’s toy to the simplest tools in our homes, so much of life has turned electronic.</p>

  <p>Maybe you’ve seen one broken open — or even taken one apart yourself — and wondered: “What are those little black rectangles on the circuit board? What do they do? And how?”</p>

  <p>Those flat, black pieces, with tiny metal legs gripping the board, are microchips. Every electronic device is, in some way, a computer. These chips are like the brain of that computer, responsible for all its operations. Inside a single chip are millions — sometimes billions — of microscopic switches that flick on and off thousands of times per second. Together, they store information, perform calculations, and control devices. They run our phones, cars, medical machines, and even the internet!</p>

  <p>But don’t imagine tiny physical switches you could flip by hand. These switches are made from a special class of materials called semiconductors, which can control electricity with incredible precision. Their small size and efficiency allow chips to be packed with power.</p>

  <p>Before microchips, technologies like vacuum tubes and relays were used — bulky, hot, and inefficient. Thanks to advances in science and technology, the size and efficiency of electronics increased rapidly. Microchips may be small, but their impact on society is enormous.</p>
