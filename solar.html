    <p>Solar energy, as we all know, is a great source of renewable energy. Though it has a bunch of advantages; it has some disadvantages also. One of them being how can we use this energy at night. A simple suggestion would be to use batteries to store the energy. But the problem is it is really costly. There are two great solutions to this problem. You can call them as sand battery and water battery. For sand battery, we gather piles of sand at a place and cover it with a thermal isolated system(you can imagine it as a huge thermo flux). At day time excessive solar energy is used to heat the sand. The good thing with the sand is it is cheap and easily available and it can store heat very efficiently. This stored heat is used to generate electricity at night. The good thing is it can be built anywhere. At hilly areas water battery can be used. For this two connected water reservers  are created at different altitudes. At the time the excessive solar energy is used to transfer the water from the lower reserve word to the upper. At night time, as the water is now on the upper reserve turbines can be used before the flow of the water to generate electricity. Yes they are not as efficient as batteries but they are cost effective and sufficient enough to give power.</p>
